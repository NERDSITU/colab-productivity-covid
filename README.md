# Code for the paper

The code in this repository is divided in following three folders:
- Productivity
- Collaboration
- NPI

Each folder contain scripts in Python and Jupyter Notebook used to make
the plots and analysis reported in the article.

To run any scrips, the interested user might need to adjust the file paths

are carried out using standard python libraries already included in the
Anaconda distribution.

This software was tested on Anaconda version `4.10.1` containing Python version
`3.8.8`.

The data to reproduced the analyses in the paper can be obtained from:
