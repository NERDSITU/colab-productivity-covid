# Instructions to run the code for the NPI analysis.

1. Keep everything in the same folder and just run it in Jupyter notebook. By doing this, we could get the Figure 3 in the main text.

2. Data origin in the folder. 'Closure and re-opening NPI among countries.csv' was downloaded from Ref. 29. 'country_closure_OR_OPERATION1124.csv' will be produced in the running of code. And other '.csv' were calculated and passed from part of Productivity.
