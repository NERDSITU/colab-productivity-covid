# Code for genderization & data curation (before Collaboration, Productivity & NPI)

## MAG (Spark setup on HPC)

## Files

### Main Files 

**PreprocessingAllDocType**: Preprocessing of MAG data. E.g. creating convenience files and filtering by year (after 2010).

**PreprocessingFilters**: Further filtering of data (e.g. by DocType and whether papers are cited and/or reference other papers).

---
### Other Files (sanity checks)

**PreprocessingReproduce**: Checks whether we can reproduce results from Lasse (sanity check).
 
**PapersDocType**: Checks distribution of scientific papers on different DocTypes and the volume of papers by year.

**NumberOfPapers**: Checks volume of papers by year, and by different filters that we have applied to the data.
 
**FiltersValidate**: Checks that our filters are reasonable in terms of volume of data.
